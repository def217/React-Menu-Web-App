# React-Menu-Web-App

Short brief:

After a sign up screen, user gets navigated to the home screen which consists of Card components. The card components are filled with data from database (firebase), so the home screen is where the all of the orders pop in. The user selects the order as done and the user on the phone app can then see that the order was marked as done.

A few screenshots for reference:
